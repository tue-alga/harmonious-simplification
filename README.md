# Harmonious Simplification

This project provides code developed in context of research into the simplification of sets of isolines in a harmonious way. 
That is, it aims to reduce its number of vertices (possibly introducing new locations as well),
while keeping the isolines similar to their original geometry and to each other.

It builds on the GeometryCore (https://github.com/tue-alga/GeometryCore) and was developed under version v1.1.0.

This version of the code supports both polygonal lines and polygons as isolines. It is re-implemented, based on the previous version, but due to changes in structures and implementation, this may give different results.
